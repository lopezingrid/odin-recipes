    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade gnocchi sounds tricky, but is pretty easy. A classic dish of the
         kitchen in many countries of the world, the irresistible potato 
         gnocchi.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients (for 4 servings)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg of potatoes</li>
        <li>300gr of flour 0000</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The first thing we are going to do <strong>wash the potatoes well 
            since we are going to boil them with the skin</strong>. This is very
            important so that later the potato gnocchi do not fall apart, since
            by cooking them with the peel we prevent them from absorbing 
            excess water. We make a horizontal cut around the contour of the 
            potato, in the video it looks good, and we take them to a pot with
            water. Cook until they fall off when punctured.</li>
        <li>We take them out and <strong>we let them cool so as not to burn 
            ourselves.</strong>
            With the cut we made, the shell has to come out very easy in two 
            parts.</li>
        <li><strong>We press the potatoes still hot</strong>, add salt, pepper 
            and mix super well. We add the beaten egg and the flour. We are not 
            going to add all the flour in one, we are going to save a little to 
            see how it comes. The amounts are rather proportional, it may be 
            that the potato has absorbed more water or that the egg is smaller, 
            so we are going to add the flour little by little.</li>
        <li><strong>Join by hand until you can move to the counter and finish 
            integrating</strong>. If in this step they see that more flour is 
            needed, we have the rest to add. It is not necessary to love a lot, 
            the idea is to reach a united and uniform mass without touching it a
            lot.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut strips of dough and make rolls</strong>, and cut pieces 
            about 2 or 3 cm wide, you can flour the knife to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Shape the gnocchi with the gnocchi or fork.</li>
        <li><strong>For cooking, bring batches to a pot of boiling salted 
            water</strong>. They will see that they fall to the bottom. When 
            they go up, they leave them for 1 minute and they are ready. you can
            serve it with sauce or cheese!</li>
    </ol>
