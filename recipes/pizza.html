        <p>Today I propose you this delicious and practical homemade pizza recipe.
            There is nothing richer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg flour 000</li>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
            <li>50 gr of fresh yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl or cup place the yeast and half a cup of warm water, 
                add the tablespoon of sugar. Mix well until bubbles form. Cover 
                and let rise for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, place the flour and mix it with the salt. Make 
                a hole in the center, and then dump the yeast. Add the rest of 
                the warm water and the oil. Join all the ingredients with your 
                hands to form a dough.</li>
            <li>Let the pizza dough rest for about 15 minutes, and then knead it 
                on a table with flour. Divide the dough into four buns of the 
                same size.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough into a circle. Put the dough in a pizza pan, 
                let it rest in a warm place until it rises a little. Approximately 
                15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add a generous tablespoon of tomato sauce and place in a strong 
                oven for about 6 minutes. This is very important so that the 
                pizza dough is well cooked.</li>
            <li>Then, add another tablespoon of tomato sauce, and on top of it 
                the cheese, tomatoes, olives and oregano. (or the ingredients 
                that you like the most). Bake until the cheese melts, and voila!</li>
